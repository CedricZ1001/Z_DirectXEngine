## Introduction

**ZoneEngine** is a custom game engine project designed to help with exploring and learning the structure and implementation of modern game engine frameworks. The goal of this project is to experiment with rendering effects, physics systems, and cross-platform rendering interfaces while gradually building a functional and extensible game engine.

This project serves as a personal journey into game engine development, providing a playground for implementing features and learning advanced rendering techniques.

## Features

- **Frontend**: 
  - Built using **WPF** (Windows Presentation Foundation) for the user interface.
  - Intuitive and simple editor design to manage scenes and assets.

- **Rendering Backend**:
  - Utilizes **DirectX 12 (DX12)** for high-performance rendering.
  - Focused on achieving real-time graphics effects.

- **Physics System**:
  - Early-stage integration for experimenting with collision detection and rigid body dynamics.
  - More features will be added in future iterations.

- **Planned RHI Layer**:
  - In future updates, a **Rendering Hardware Interface (RHI)** will be implemented to abstract platform-specific APIs.
  - Aims to support multiple platforms (e.g., Vulkan, Metal, and OpenGL).

## Why ZoneEngine?

This project provides:
1. **Learning Opportunity**: A hands-on approach to understand the architecture and working of game engines.
2. **Experimentation Platform**: Test and implement modern rendering techniques and physics simulations.
3. **Framework Design Practice**: Build a scalable, modular engine framework from scratch.

## Development Stack

- **Frontend**: WPF (C#)
- **Backend**: 
  - **DirectX 12 (DX12)** for rendering.
  - Custom frameworks for physics and scene management (in progress).
- **Future Plans**: 
  - Introduce RHI (Rendering Hardware Interface) for cross-platform support.
  - Support additional rendering backends such as Vulkan and Metal.

## Planned Features

- **Editor Features**:
  - Asset and scene management through an intuitive WPF interface.
  - Real-time previews of rendering effects.

- **Rendering Effects**:
  - Advanced lighting models (PBR, shadow mapping, etc.).
  - Post-processing effects such as bloom, tone mapping, and ambient occlusion.

- **Physics Engine**:
